					mean any information of any kind relating to a natural person who
					can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by
					reference to such data.</p>

					indirectly, in particular by reference to an identification number
					or to one or more factors specific to his or her physical,
					physiological, mental, economic, cultural or social status.</p>

				<p>Our Privacy policy applies to all users, and others who
					access the App ("Users").</p>

				<p>For the purposes of the GDPR, we are the data controller,
					unless otherwise stated.</p>

				<p>IF YOU ARE A CALIFORNIA RESIDENT PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING
					IMPORTANT NOTICE</p>
				<p>Under the Vietnam Consumer Privacy Act of 2020 (CCPA)
					Vietnam residents shall have the right to request:</p>

				<p>the categories of personal information that is processed;</p>

					not include de-identified or aggregated consumer information.</p>
				<h2>SHARING</h2>

				<p>How your information can be shared &gt;&gt;</p>

				<p>Please note that all third parties that are engaged in
					processing user data are service providers that&nbsp; use such
					information on the basis of agreement and pursuant to business
					purpose.&nbsp;</p>
				<h2>OPT-OUT OPTIONS</h2>

				<p>If you don’t want us to process your personal information any
					more please contact us through the [contact form]. In most cases
					there is no way to maintain the App’s further operating without
					functional data therefore you will be advised to remove the App
					from your device.&nbsp; If you don’t want us to share device identifiers
					and geolocation data with service providers please check your
					device settings to opt out as described below &gt;&gt;</p>
				<h2>REQUESTS</h2>

					portability or deletion personal data please contact us through the
					[contact form]. Please include in the text of your appeal the
					wording "Your rights to maintain confidentiality in the state of
					Vietnam".</p>

					verify you are the person about whom we collected personal
					information or an authorized representative, which may include:
					name, address, city, state, and zip code and email address. We may
					use this information to surface a series of security questions to
					you to verify your identity. If you are making a request through an
					authorized agent acting on your behalf, such authorized agent must
					provide written authorization confirming or a power of attorney,
					signed by you.</p>

					authority to make the request; or (ii) confirm the personal
					information relates to you. We may ask you for additional
					information or documents to verify your identity. We may also carry
					out checks, including with third party identity verification
					services, to verify your identity before taking any action with
					your personal information. This is regarded as a safeguard measure
					to prevent disclosure of your personal information under a fake or
					scum request.</p>

				<p>We ensure that personal information provided in a verifiable
					consumer request will be used only to verify the requestor’s
					identity or authority to make the request and not for any other
					purpose. We will keep it for the adequate term reasonably needed
					for the purpose described above and delete after the purpose is
					fulfilled.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

				<h2>II. INFORMATION WE PROCESS</h2>

				<p>There are several categories of information that can be
					processed.</p>
				<h4>Functional Information</h4>
				&nbsp;

				<p>We ask for and process the following personal information
					when you use the App. This information is necessary for the
					adequate performance of the contract between you and us. Without
					such information it is impossible to provide complete functionality
					of the App and perform the requested services.</p>

				<p>Activity Information directly related to your use of the App.
					We may have technical access to your camera roll required to
					analyze the document info (file format, number of pages, etc) and
					available instruments for document editing. However, we cannot
					collect, store or use the data contained in your camera roll.</p>
				<p>All scanned documents are stored locally on your device, they
					are inaccessible either to us or to any third party. Only you can
					share documents to certain party by exporting them through the App.</p>

				<p>Contact Information (name, e-mail address, as well as any
					other content included in the email) which you may fill in by
					yourself when you contact us via email, support form. We collect,
					store and process it by our cloud storage provider (Amazon.com,
					Inc.). We&nbsp; use&nbsp; such information to respond effectively to your
					inquiry, fulfill your requests, and send you communications that
					you request and perform the requested services.</p>
				<p>Information That Is Processed Automatically</p>

				<p>When you use the App, some information about your device and
					your user behaviour may be processed automatically. This
					information is generally non-personal, i.e. it does not, on its
					own, permit direct association with any specific individual, and we
					may access it only in aggregated form. We process this information
					on the ground of our legitimate interest in improving our App and
					giving our users the best experience. If we do not access such data
					we may not be able to provide you with all the features of the App.</p>

				<p>We use third-party automatic data processing technologies to
					analyze certain information sent by your device via our App
					(advertising or analytics tools). Some of them launch automated
					processing of your personal data, including profiling, which means
					any form of automated processing of personal data used to evaluate
					certain personal aspects relating to you, in particular to analyze
					or predict aspects concerning your personal preferences, interests,
					behavior, location or movements (see the list of data described
					below). Processing information through automatic data processing
					technologies starts automatically when you first time launch the
					App.</p>

				<p>Device Details. When you use a mobile device (tablet / phone
					/ smartwatch) to access our App, some of details about your device
					are reported, including "device identifiers". Device identifiers
					are small data files or similar data structures stored on or
					associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your
					mobile device (but not your personality). Device identifier enables
					generalized reporting or personalized content and ads by the third
					parties.</p>
				<p>What data can be processed:</p>
				<p>Information about the device itself: type of your device,
					type of operating system and its version, model and manufacturer,
					screen size, screen density, orientation, audio volume and battery,
					device memory usage. Information about the internet connection:
					mobile carrier, network provider, network type, IP address,
					timestamp and duration of sessions, speed, browser.&nbsp;
					Location-related information: IP address, the country code/ region/
					state/ city associated with your SIM card or your device, language
					setting, time zone, neighboring commercial points of interest (eg.
					"coffee shop"). Device identifiers: Identity For Advertisers for
					iOs devices/ Advertising ID or Android ID for Android devices, user
					identifiers (if they are set up by the App’s developer).
					Information about the applications. Name, API key (identifier for
					application), version, properties of our App can be reported for
					automated processing and analyzes. Some services also record the
					list of applications and/or processes which are installed or run on
					your device. Cookies and similar technologies. When you use the
					App, cookies and similar technologies may be used (pixels, web
					beacons, scripts). A cookie is a text file containing small amounts
					of information which is downloaded to your device when you access
					the App. The text file is then sent back to the server each time
					you use the App. This enables us to operate the App more
					effectively. For example, we will know how many users access a
					specific areas or features within our App and which links or ads
					they clicked on. We use this aggregated information to understand
					and optimize how our App is used, improve our marketing efforts,
					and provide content and features that are of interest to you. We
					may ask advertisers or other partners to serve ads or services to
					the App, which may use cookies or similar technologies. Log file
					information. Log file information is automatically reported each
					time you make a request to access the App. It can also be provided
					when the App is installed on your device. When you use our App,
					analytics tools automatically record certain log file information,
					including time and date when you start and stop using the App, and
					how you interact with the App. Ad-related information. The
					following data might be reported about the ads you can view: the
					date and time a particular ad is served; a record if that ad was
					"clicked" or if it was shown as a "conversion" event; what the ad
					offer is about; what type of ad it is (e.g., text, image, or
					video); which ad placement is involved (where the ad offer is
					displayed within the App); whether you respond to the ad.&nbsp;</p>
				<p>In-app events. When you use our App, analytics tools
					automatically record your activity information (tutorial steps,
					levelling up, payments, in-app purchases, custom events,
					progression events, method of limiting the processing of user
					data). Information provided automatically to advertising or
					analytics tools does not generally come to our control, therefore
					we cannot be responsible for processing such information. Please
					mind that some services are engaged in personal data profiling and
					may obtain information related to your personality and/or your
					device by using technologies that do not belong to our scope of
					responsibility. In case when your user ID is linked to your
					Facebook account, Facebook may use your device information in
					association with categorized data that were already recorded in its
					databases (eg. your age, gender or other demographic indication).
					We do not control, supervise or stand surety for how the third
					parties process your personal data, that might be collected by
					their own means (not through our App). Any information request
					regarding the disclosure of your personal information should be
					directed to such third parties (see Section IV).&nbsp;</p>
				<h4>Payment Information&nbsp;</h4>

				<p>Our e-commerce provider (Apple / Google) is responsible for
					billing, processing and charging for the in-app purchases, handles
					your personal information and keeps it absolutely safe and secure.
					We cannot access or use you credit or debit card information. You
					may access the applicable "in-app" purchase rules and policies
					directly from the app stores.</p>

					parameters we suggest you help us with the reference material so
					that the processing technologies of our App could be reformed,
					smartened and smoothed. Your collaboration is crucial for us when
					we aspire to enhance our methods and improve the services.</p>
